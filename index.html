<h1>Welcome to a public UDD mirror</h1>
<p>This is a public, <em>unofficial</em> mirror of
the <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/UltimateDebianDatabase">Ultimate Debian Database</a>.</p>
<h1>How to use it</h1>
<p>Use these credentials:</p>
<ul>
<li>Host: public-udd-mirror.xvm.mit.edu</li>
<li>Port: 5432</li>
<li>Database: udd</li>
<li>Username: public-udd-mirror</li>
<li>Password: public-udd-mirror</li>
</ul>
<p>Or (remember, the password is public-udd-mirror):</p>
<pre>psql --host=public-udd-mirror.xvm.mit.edu --user=public-udd-mirror --password udd</pre>
<h1>Help</h1>
<p>The best way to report issues is using <a href="https://github.com/paulproteus/public-udd-mirror/issues">Github issues</a>.</p>
<p>I will also track to-do entries there.<p>
<p>The debian-qa mailing list is the best way to reach the UDD team. You can also find Asheesh there, and he doesn't mind if you discuss problems on the mailing list instead of via personal mail to him. Note that since this mirror is unofficial, it is provided on a best-effort basis and Asheesh is fundamentally responsible for maintaining server uptime, not anyone else on the debian-qa list.</p>
<h1>Thanks</h1>
<p>Hosted by XVM at MIT.</p>
